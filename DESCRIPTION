Description: Logging framework dedicated for complex shiny apps. 
    Different types of events can be logged (character string, 
    value of a variable, multi-line output of a function,
    result of a unit test, custom error, warning, or diagnostic message).
    Each event can be logged with a list of parameters that are event-specific, 
    common for a group of events, or common for all app events.
    Logging can be done simultaneously to R console, 
    browser JavaScript console, a file log, and a database (currently MongoDB).
    Log data can be further analyzed with the help of process-mining techniques 
    from 'bupaR' package.
