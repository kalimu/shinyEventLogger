Description: Logging dedicated to Shiny apps. You can log different types
    of events, for example: character string, current value of a variable, 
    multi-line output of a function (eg. str(data.frame) or head(data.frame)), 
    result of a unit test (using testthat), 
    custom errors, warnings, diagnostic messages, etc.
    Logging can be done simultaneously to R console, 
    JavaScript console in a browser, to a file log, and to a database (MongoDB).
    Log data can be analysed with the help of process-mining techniques from 
    bupaR package.
