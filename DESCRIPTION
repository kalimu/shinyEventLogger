Description: Logging framework dedicated for complex shiny apps. 
    Different types of events can be logged 
    (value of a variable, multi-line output of a function,
    result of a unit test, custom error, warning, or diagnostic message).
    Each event can be logged with a list of parameters that are event-specific, 
    common for events within the same scope, session-specific, or app-wide.
    Logging can be done simultaneously to R console, 
    browser JavaScript console, a file log, and a database (MongoDB).
    Log data can be further analyzed with the help of process-mining techniques 
    from 'bupaR' package.
