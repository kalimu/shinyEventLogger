Description: Logging dedicated to Shiny apps. You can log different types
    of events: character string, current value of a variable, 
    multiline output of a function (eg. str(data.frame) or head(data.frame)), 
    result of a unit test, errors, warnings, diagnostic messages, etc.
    Logging can be done simultaneously to R console, 
    JavaScript console in a browser, or to a file log.
    Log data can be analysed with the help of dedicated functions 
    and process-mining techniques.
