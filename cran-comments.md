## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added missing examples to all exported functions,
* removed \dontrun{} from most examples,
* replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{} in few function examples (like run_demo())
* updated links in Readme and added links to demo apps hosted on shinyapps.io

## Test environments
* Win7 64-bit (local), R version 3.5.2
* Travis-ci (release, devel)
* Win-builder R (release, devel)

## R CMD check results
On local environment there were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

On Win-builder there was 1 NOTE:
